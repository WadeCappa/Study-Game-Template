# Study-Game-Template
Simple study program in C++, any user can input data in the provided template, allows the program to quiz them on that information. 

Used to apply and develop my understanding of OOP inheritance and polymorphism, as well as other basic OOP standards. I also used this program to better learn and apply Clean Code best practicies.
